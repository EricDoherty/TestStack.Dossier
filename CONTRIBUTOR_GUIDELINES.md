Contributor Guidelines
======================

Hi! Thank you for your interest in contributing to this open source library!
We ask that you follow the following style guidelines when submitting pull
requests, to keep the code consistent and maintainable.

 - Do not put an if clause and it's statement on the same line: separate them
   with a new-line and indent accordingly.
