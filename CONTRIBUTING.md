Contributor Guidelines
======================

Hi! Thank you for your interest in contributing to this open source library!

We welcome issues and pull requests. If you are starting on something major
please raise an issue first so we can discuss it with you, make sure it fits
in with the direction of the project and provide appropriate assistance :)

We ask that you follow the following style guidelines when submitting pull
requests, to keep the code consistent and maintainable.

 - In general - follow the default ReSharper suggestions
 - Do not put a single line if clause on the same line as the if statement it
    belongs to; separate them with a new-line and an indent
